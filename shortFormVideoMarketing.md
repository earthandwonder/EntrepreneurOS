# B2C Short-Form Video Marketing Framework

## Introduction
B2C shorts is a really tough game because it's a social virality game, while social virality content is very hard thing to conceptualise and put into a framework (because the culture is so different)

I watched 1,000+ b2c shorts and got 30M+ views from my own organic shorts. Here's is my **attempt to theorize b2c organic shorts content game:**

## Framework Goals
1. Be able to categorise EVERY single short-form video you see (that is used to promote a mobile app). I.e. you should be able to categorise all the examples from [iamgdsa](https://twitter.com/iamgdsa) into one of these 9 content approaches
2. With this categorization, any b2c startups can try to go through the 9 core content approaches and find the approach that fits their app most, and run an in-house organic team easily, instead of spending $$$ on ads

## Core Theory
Every shorts can be first categorised between 'face' and 'faceless' content types.

### Face Content Types
Face content can be divided into "hook-based" and "no hook" categories:
- **Hook-based**: Shorts that rely on a 3-5 seconds hook, then show the main content (usually the product)
- **No-hook**: The main content itself is the hook, with no clear distinction between hook and content

#### Hook-Based Content Types
1. **Talking Head** (50% of viral videos)
   - A person, usually a cute girl, talking about a relatable scenario
   
2. **POV** (30% of viral videos)
   - Not showing a person's talking head
   - Recording the environment
   - Example: [coconoteapp](https://twitter.com/coconoteapp)'s classical viral lecture hall video
   
3. **Transition** (10% of viral videos)
   - Use another viral video as the hook
   - Smoothly edit a transition to the product
   
4. **Peak** (10% of viral videos)
   - The camera person peeking at another person's phone or laptop

#### No-Hook Content Types
5. **Lifestyle**
   - Day in life series/gym with me type of video
   - High video quality
   - Attractive model showcasing their life
   
6. **Skit**
   - Funny scripted/staged skit
   - Product integration within the skit
   
7. **Street Interview**
   - Self-explanatory format

### Faceless Content Types
8. **Memes**
   - Example: [dropship](https://twitter.com/dropship) on Instagram
   
9. **High-Quality Edits**
   - Example: [bymaximise](https://twitter.com/bymaximise)

## Content Strategy
Content approach is like the form factor of the video. We still need the actual content to fill the form factor. Since shorts is about relating with the mass, we need to think about how we want to make people feel.

### Three Key Relation Strategies
1. **Amused**
   - Funny content that makes people laugh
   
2. **Understood**
   - Common experiences that are relatable
   
3. **Enlightened**
   - Educational content that makes you learn

## Implementation
You can combine the 9 content approaches with these 3 key relation strategies, giving you 27 different ways of making content. Your goal is to test each of these combinations and see which one goes viral for your app. Experienced people can tell which content approach suits best for you.
